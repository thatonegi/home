     <h2>Ledding Library of Milwaukie <br />
     Access to Internet Resources </h2>
     </center><br />
     <strong>Time Limit</strong><br />
     <div>
     Internet usage is limited to one hour per patron per day at the Milwaukie Ledding Library. </div>
     <div>&nbsp;</div>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <strong>WIFI</strong><br />
     There is no time limit on use of the library&#8217;s WIFI accessed through a patron&#8217;s personal device. However, the same rules apply to internet use through WIFI that apply to patrons on internet stations. Downloading large files is not permitted, as such activity results in poor performance for all users of the internet in the library and such downloads are frequently in violation of copyright. Access to sites that violate this Acceptable Use Policy apply to WIFI use as well.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <br />
     <strong>Purpose</strong><br />
     Part of the mission of the Ledding Library of Milwaukie is to &#8220;provide people of all ages with access and personalized guidance to information and collections that reflect all points of view. The library supports pursuit of education and personal goals by providing informational, recreational and cultural materials and services including those utilizing advancing technologies.&#8221; To that end, the Ledding Library of Milwaukie will protect intellectual freedom, promote literacy, encourage lifelong learning and provide library materials and information resources. In introducing the Internet as an information resource, the Ledding Library&#8217;s goal is to enhance its existing collection in size and depth and, as a public access agency, give the opportunity to any citizen who wishes to use the Internet.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     Throughout its history, the Ledding Library of Milwaukie has made information available in a variety of formats, from print to film to compact disk. Integrating electronic resources from outside networks with the Library&#8217;s many other resources allows access to ideas, information and commentary from around the world and demonstrates what the Internet can mean to the citizens of Milwaukie, regardless of education, occupation, economic status or age.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <br />
     <strong>Responsibility of Users</strong><br />
     The freedom to access information is also a responsibility. The Internet enables the Ledding Library to provide resources not available within its own collection. Currently, however, the Internet is an unregulated medium. It offers access to a wealth of material that is personally, professionally and culturally enriching to individuals of all ages, but it also enables access to some material that may be offensive and/or illegal. Internet resources are not subject to the same selection criteria that the Ledding Library uses for other materials. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the library Internet user to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including ORS 167.087, &#8220;Disseminating obscene materials".
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     The Library strives to balance the rights of users to access various types of information resources with the rights of users to work in a public environment free from disruptive sounds and visuals. There are information resources on the Internet that are inappropriate for viewing in a public setting. Because the Library is a public place shared by people of all ages, library staff reserves the right to end an Internet session when such material is displayed.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <br />
     <strong>Children&#8217;s Use of the Internet</strong><br />
     The Ledding Library will also provide an Internet station in the Rowe Children&#8217;s Library, reserved for youth and will provide a &#8220;Kid&#8217;s Page&#8221; with appealing and age-appropriate reading levels and links. The library staff will be able to provide assistance and to help identify appropriate sites for children exploring the Internet. The Ledding Library upholds and affirms the right and responsibility of parents and guardians to determine and monitor their children&#8217;s use of all library materials and resources. Library users, whether children or adults, are the final selectors in using the Internet and are responsible for their individual choices and decisions.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <div>
     <strong></strong></div>
     <div>&nbsp;</div>
     <div><strong>Internet Use Rules and Procedures</strong></div>
     <div>
     In an effort to ensure fair, equitable and productive use of its Internet services by everyone, the Ledding Library of Milwaukie establishes these rules and procedures for each library Internet user. Each user must, of course, follow all other library policies and procedures. The general expectation of these rules is that Internet users will behave in a manner that does not disturb other library users, disrupt the operation of the library, or endanger library materials and equipment.</div>

     The Ledding Library of Milwaukie reserves the right to suspend the library privileges, including use of the Internet, of anyone who willfully violates library policies or procedures. Repeat offenses may result in permanent suspension from the library.
